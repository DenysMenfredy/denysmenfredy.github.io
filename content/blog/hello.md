# Hello World! This is my first blog post.


I've been trying to build a blog a long time ago, and it never worked out. My goal writing here is to simply document my learning journey and also try to help other people that is also curious about the things I'm writing about.

If you are interested in any of the following topics, stay in touch:


- Artificial Intelligence:
    - Evolutionary Computation; 
    - Machine Learning
    - Generative AI;
    - Neural Networks; 

- Web development;
- Databases (SQL and NoSQL);
- Cloud;
- Coding in general;
- Tech interviews (problem solving + tips);
