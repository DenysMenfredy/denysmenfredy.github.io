# Test Automation

This is a test blog post to verify that the `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields are being automatically populated from Git information.

The metadata should now be automatically generated based on:
- **createdAt**: First commit date when this file was added to Git
- **updatedAt**: Most recent commit date or file modification date

No more manual date entry required!
